Project proposal (03/09 @ 23:55)

Submit a one-page proposal listing the project members and describing your chosen theme. You should use the ACM LaTeX (sample-sigconf.tex) template.

The proposal will serve as a starting point for a series of discussions toward formalizing your project. All projects should include the following information:

Project title
Project author
Project track (research or development)
Research projects should also discuss the following questions:

What problem are you addressing?
Are there any existing solutions? (Google Scholar is your friend)
How do you plan to address the problem? (note: your proposed solution may naturally evolve as you familiarize yourself with the problem)
How do you plan to evaluate your proposed solution?
Development projects should also discuss the following questions:

Which software toolkit (e.g., Lucene) will you build upon?
What is your proposed extension for implementation?
Has it been implemented before?
How do you plan to validate your implementation?
